# Network Telemetry & Multimedia Transmission over UDP

This repository contains a complete implementation of a UDP-based communication client used for:

- Echo packet RTT measurements (with and without induced delay)
- Image retrieval from remote cameras
- Audio streaming using DPCM and AQ-DPCM
- Vehicle OBD-II telemetry decoding
- UAV (IthakiCopter) telemetry collection

All Java components are fully modularized into separate classes (packet handling, image decoding, sound reconstruction, telemetry parsing).  
Two measurement sessions (`session1` and `session2`) are included, each containing:

- Raw measurement files generated by the Java client  
- Derived datasets and results based on offline analysis  
- Plots and metrics such as mean RTT, variance, BER, and retransmission statistics  

The project is structured so that each session is fully reproducible and self-contained.

## Offline Analysis

Measurement data are exported by the Java client in CSV format and processed post-execution to extract:

- RTT evolution over time  
- Throughput over fixed time windows  
- Packet error and retransmission statistics  
- DPCM and AQ-DPCM signal characteristics  
- Vehicle and UAV telemetry trends  

All plots included in each session directory are generated from these exported datasets.

## Requirements

### Java

- JDK 8 or newer  
- DatagramSocket UDP support (standard in Java SE)

## Notes

- All RTT-related metrics (mean, variance, BER, retransmissions) are derived from raw UDP measurements.
- AQ-DPCM parameters *(a, bt, c)* used in the measurements are documented in each session’s `parameters.txt`.
- The project focuses on protocol behavior, measurement accuracy, and performance evaluation rather than UI or visualization tooling.
